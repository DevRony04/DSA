# 🚀 DSA Practice for FAANG Interviews  

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** Repository 🎯  
This repository showcases my **daily problem-solving journey** focused on mastering algorithms and patterns for **FAANG-level coding interviews** (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other top tech companies.  

---

## 📘 About This Repository
This repo contains **well-structured Java solutions** to selected **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **InterviewBit** problems.

Each problem file includes:
- 💡 **Optimized approach** with explanation & time-space complexity.  
- 🧠 **Recognized patterns** (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Recursion, DP, Graphs, etc.).  
- ⚡ **Accepted Java solutions** (often 0 ms runtime on LeetCode).  
- 🗂️ Organized by **problem ID + title** for easy lookup (e.g., `57-insert-interval.java`).

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Philosophy
I believe in mastering **patterns** rather than memorizing problems.  
This helps recognize problem structures instantly — a crucial FAANG skill.

🧠 **Core Focus Areas:**
- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Binary Search Trees  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (1D / 2D / State DP)  
- Greedy & Divide-and-Conquer  
- Bit Manipulation
