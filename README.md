# 🚀 DSA Practice for FAANG Interviews  

Welcome to my **DSA Repository** 🎯  
Here I solve **LeetCode DSA problems daily** to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for **FAANG companies** (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other top tech firms.

## 📌 About This Repository
- Contains **Java solutions** to popular LeetCode problems.  
- Problems are organized by their **LeetCode ID and title** (e.g., `26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array`).  
- Each solution includes:
  - Optimized approach (`O(n)` or better when possible).  
  - Clean, readable code.  
  - Accepted submissions (often **0 ms runtime** ⚡ on LeetCode).

## 🏆 Goals
- ✅ Solve **1–2 problems daily**.  
- ✅ Cover **Patterns** (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion, DP, Graphs, etc.).  
- ✅ Build a strong foundation for **FAANG interviews**.  
- ✅ Track consistency and improvement.
